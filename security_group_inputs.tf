# KEEP this top comment block, but REMOVE COMMENTS below that are intended

#
# This file provides the standard inputs that all Cloud Posse Open Source
# Terraform module that create AWS Security Groups should implement.
# This file does NOT provide implementation of the inputs, as that
# of course varies with each module.
#
# This file documents, but does not declare, the standard outputs modules should create,
# again because the implementation will vary with modules.
#
# Unlike null-label context.tf, this file cannot be automatically updated
# because of the tight integration with the module using it.
