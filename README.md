Terraform module to provision [Amazon Managed Streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) for [Apache Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/what-is-kafka/)

__Note:__ this module is intended for use with an existing VPC.
  To create a new VPC, use [terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc) module.

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


Here's how to invoke this example module in your projects

```hcl
module "kafka" {
  source                 = "https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-msk-apache-kafka-cluster.git?ref=master"
  namespace              = "eg"
  stage                  = "prod"
  name                   = "app"
  vpc_id                 = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
  zone_id                = "Z14EN2YD427LRQ"
  security_groups        = ["sg-XXXXXXXXX", "sg-YYYYYYYY"]
  subnet_ids             = ["subnet-XXXXXXXXX", "subnet-YYYYYYYY"]
  kafka_version          = "2.4.1"
  number_of_broker_nodes = 3
  broker_instance_type   = "kafka.m5.large"
}
```
